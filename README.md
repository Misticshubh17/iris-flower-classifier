# Iris Flower Classifier  

A machine learning project that classifies Iris flowers into three species (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, *Virginica*) based on their sepal and petal measurements.  

## Project Overview
The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning, containing 150 samples with 4 features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width  

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation using various machine learning algorithms.
